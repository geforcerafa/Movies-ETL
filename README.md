# Amazing Prime Data Analysis

## Overview of Project

Data analysis project using Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring to create an automated pipeline that takes new data of movies from different sources, performs the required transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 



### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to take different data sources, in this case they were movie data from json and csv files. Clean the data and transform it so it is ready for analysis. In the final stage the data is stored in a Data Base. 

At the end of the transformation process the data is ready for analysis.
